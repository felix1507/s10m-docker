# s10m - E3/DC S10 Modbus to MQTT connector

This software module connects a E3/DC S10 home power station with a MQTT broker. It uses the Modbus interface of the S10 device.

Developed and tested with a Raspberry Pi.

The tool s10m queries the data from the home power station and sends it to the MQTT broker. The following topics are supported:

- s10/autarky
- s10/consumption
- s10/battery/charging/limit
- s10/battery/charging/lock
- s10/battery/discharging/lock
- s10/emergency/ready
- s10/grid/limit
- s10/battery/soc
- s10/battery/power
- s10/battery/state
- s10/emergency/mode
- s10/firmware
- s10/grid/power
- s10/grid/state
- s10/grid/power/L1
- s10/grid/power/L2
- s10/grid/power/L3
- s10/home/power
- s10/manufacturer
- s10/model
- s10/serial_number
- s10/solar/power
- s10/string_1/current
- s10/string_2/current
- s10/string_1/power
- s10/string_2/power
- s10/string_1/voltage
- s10/string_2/voltage

Only modified values will be published.

## Prerequisite

- S10 configuration: Switch on the Modbus interface (mode E3/DC, not Sunspec)
- An existing MQTT broker in your environment, e.g. a Mosquitto (https://mosquitto.org)
- s10m needs the library libmosquitto. To install it on a Raspberry Pi enter:

```
sudo apt-get install libmosquitto-dev
```
- s10m connects the S10 via the Modbus protocol, so you have to install a Modbus library:
```
git clone https://github.com/stephane/libmodbus.git
cd libmodbus/
sudo apt-get install libtool # when autogen or configure fail
./autogen.sh
./configure
sudo make install
```

## Cloning the Repository

```
sudo apt-get install git # if necessary
git clone https://github.com/pvtom/s10m.git
```

## Configuration

Please check the configuration values in the source code file s10m.h and adjust them to your needs.
```
// Host name of the E3/DC S10 device
MODBUS_HOST=e3dc
// Port of the E3/DC S10 device, default is 502
MODBUS_PORT=502
// Target MQTT broker
MQTT_HOST=localhost
// Default port is 1883
MQTT_PORT=1883
// MQTT parameters
MQTT_QOS=0
MQTT_RETAIN=false
// Interval requesting the E3/DC S10 device in seconds
POLL_INTERVAL=1
```

## Compilation

```
cd s10m
make
```

## Build docker container

IMPORTENT: Make shure the [configuration](#configuration) is correct for you.

```
docker build -t <image-name> .
```

## Installation

```
sudo mkdir -p /opt/s10m
sudo chown pi:pi /opt/s10m/
```
Adjust user and group (pi:pi) if you use another user.

```
cp -a s10m /opt/s10m
```

## Test

Start the program:

```
./s10m
```

If everything works properly, you get output like this:

```

```

Check the configuration if the connections are not established.

If you use the Mosquitto tools you can subscribe the topics with

```
mosquitto_sub -h localhost -p 1883 -t 's10/#' -v
```

Stop s10m with Crtl-C and start it in the background.

## Daemon Mode

Start the program in daemon mode:

```
./s10m -d
```

If you like to start `s10m` during the system start, use `/etc/rc.local`. Add the following line before `exit 0`.

```
(cd /opt/s10m ; /usr/bin/sudo -H -u pi /opt/s10m/s10m -d)
```
Adjust the user (pi) if you use another user.

The daemon can be terminated with
```
pkill s10m
```
Be careful that the program runs only once.
